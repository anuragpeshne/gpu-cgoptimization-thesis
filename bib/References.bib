abstract = {Abstract ACES II, a new program system for ab initio electronic structure calculations is described. The strengths of ACES II involve the use of many‐body perturbation theory (MBPT) and coupled‐cluster (CC) theory for calculating the energy, geometry, spectra, and properties of small‐ to medium‐sized molecules. This paper gives a brief overview of the ACES II project, describes many features of the program system, and documents a number of benchmark calculations. © 1992 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}

abstract = {Abstract The Advanced Concepts in Electronic Structure (ACES) III software is a completely rewritten implementation for parallel computer architectures of the most used capabilities in ACES II, including the calculation of the electronic structure of molecular ground states and excited states, and determination of molecular geometries and of vibrational frequencies using many‐body and coupled cluster methods. To achieve good performance on modern parallel systems while simultaneously offering a software development environment that allows rapid implementation of new methods and algorithms, ACES III was written using a new software infrastructure, the super instruction architecture comprising a domain‐specific language, super instruction assembly language (SIAL), and a sophisticated runtime environment, super instruction processor (SIP). The architecture of ACES III is described as well as the inner workings of SIAL and SIP. The execution performance of ACES III and the productivity of programming in SIAL are discussed. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

abstract="The usage and adoption of General Purpose GPUs (GPGPU) in HPC systems is increasing due to the unparalleled performance advantage of the GPUs and the ability to fulfill the ever-increasing demands for floating points operations. While the GPU can offload many of the application parallel computations, the system architecture of a GPU-CPU-InfiniBand server does require the CPU to initiate and manage memory transfers between remote GPUs via the high speed InfiniBand network. In this paper we introduce for the first time a new innovative technology---GPUDirect that enables Tesla GPUs to transfer data via InfiniBand without the involvement of the CPU or buffer copies, hence dramatically reducing the GPU communication time and increasing overall system performance and efficiency. We also explore for the first time the performance benefits of GPUDirect using Amber and LAMMPS applications.",
