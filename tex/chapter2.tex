\chapter{RELATED WORK}\label{lit}

We discuss work done by others in using GPU for scientific calculations using
several methods such as directive based GPU programming models, using Cuda in
higher level programming language and use of GPU in previous versions of ACES
and work done using prefetching to hide latency in accessing data. We also look
at work done in general idea of prefetching such as non blocking fetch operation,
techniques used to determine optimal prefetching parameters such as number of
blocks to prefetch, prefetch cache size.

\section{GPGPU}
This section discuss previoud work done on Genral Purpose computing on Graphics
Processing Units.

\subsection{Directive Based GPU programming}
There are several attempts in area of directive based programming models. These
attempts include OpenACC~\cite{openacc}, OpenMP for
accelerator~\cite{openmpforaccelerators}, and less updated attempts including
OpenMPC~\cite{openmpc} and hiCuda~\cite{hicuda}. The approach taken by these models
is to make a implementation GPU ready by placing directives which make
execution of loops parallel. In contrast, SIA exploits coarse grained
concurrency using super instructions and super numbers or blocks by executing
super instruction on GPU. These super instructions in turn exploit fine grained
concurrency and can make use of above models to make an existing CPU implementation
GPU ready by inserting suitable directives or have a completely rewritten low level
Cuda implementation. Thus these models work \textit{with} the previously mentioned
models rather than against them.

\subsection{GPU in Computational Chemistry}
There are implementations of coupled cluster methods in computational chemistry
on GPUs reported~\cite{bhaskar2013}\cite{deprince2011}\cite{maw2011}. In these
implementations, a specific algorithm was selected and then implemented on a
GPU in a highly optimized form. These implementations have hardware specific
optimizations, and are not generic enough to remain effective as new hardware
development takes place.

One of the implementation of contraction operators on a GPU by
Ma~et~al.~\cite{Ma2013} generates CUDA code to directly implement the contractions
by optimizing for the particular order of indices in the contractions. This, as
compared to using permutations and then two dimensional matrix-matrix multiplication
as implemented in SIA, should achieve better performance for a contraction. These
specialized CUDA contraction implementations were added to NWChem, a computational
chemistry package, and considerable speedups are reported for CCSD(T) calculation
on CPU/GPU hybrid systems. Such optimized operators can be incorporated into SIA
and be provided as built in block super instruction for contraction.

\subsection{GPU Programming in Other High Level Programming Languages}
Several attempts for support for GPU in general purpose high level programming
languages have been made. A few examples include PyCUDA~\cite{pycuda2011},
jCUDA~\cite{jcuda2009} and Chapel~\cite{chapelgpu}. These toolkits gives an interface
to GPU from high level programming languages such as Python and Java but
programmer still needs to deal with low level GPU book keeping such as memory
management and defining kernels. Whereas in SIA, once the superinstructions are
defined, runtime can jump between GPU and CPU implementation transparently to
the domain programmer, the runtime takes care of memory management and GPU
implementations of common operations on blocks are build into the runtime.

\subsection{GPU in Previous Versions of ACES}
There has been work done previously to exploit GPU in Super Instruction
Architecture by Jindal~et~al~\cite{Jindal2016} in ACESIII. This implementation
required programmer to mark a block of code to be executed on GPU using
directives \texttt{gpu\_on} and \texttt{gpu\_off} and manually manage memory
transfer to and from GPU. Executing operations on small blocks on GPU can
actually be slower than executing on CPU due to time spent in memory transfer and
insignificant gain in speed. Thus it is better to execute small blocks with 2
indices on CPU and larger block with 4 and up indices on GPU. It was left to the
SIAL programmer to take this call on which block is large enough so that benefit
of executing it on GPU becomes significant.

\section{Prefetching}
Prefetching is an old technique~\cite{anacker68}\cite{Smith1982}\cite{Vanderwiel2000}
used to get data up in memory hierarchy before they are actually needed by processor
with the aim to hide the data access latency due to difference in speed to access
data. A variety of approaches, including hardware prefetching and caching, compiler
techniques, pre-execution and runtime execution, have been implemented in high
performance computing.

Hardware prefetching techniques including techniques such as transferring separate
cache blocks~\cite{Smith1978} were implemented much before software techniques were
implemented. Porterfield~\cite{Porterfield1989} introduced idea of software prefetching
using special instruction to preload values into the cache without blocking the
computation. Using this instruction the compiler can inform the cache over 100
cycles before a load is required.

Prefetching is also exploited in area of disk IO apart from feeding processor cache
from memory. Patterson et al~\cite{Patterson1994} implemented informed prefetching
mechanism for IO intensive application to exploit highly parallel IO systems. The
mechanism depends on disclosure of future access dynamically.

Dahlgren and StenstroÌˆm~\cite{Dahlgren1993} developed an algorithm to determine the
number of memory blocks to prefetch. They proposed
\textit{adaptive sequential prefetching} policy, which allows the number of blocks
to prefetch, K to vary during runtime of the program to reflect spatial locality
shown by the program. K is varied by calculating \textit{prefetch efficiency} metric
which is defined as the ratio of useful prefetched blocks to the total number of
prefetched blocks. If the prefetch efficiency exceeds a threshold then K is
incremented and decremented if it drops below a lower threshold. The value of K
can reach 0, effectively disabling prefetching.

There had been work done by Bhatia el al~\cite{Bhatia2010} to determine size of
cache to maximize hit rate in a sequential prefetching scheme. In this work, an
online algorithm is devised which saves the blocks evicted from prefetch cache
into another cache, \textit{evicted cache}. If the incoming request is satisfied
by evicted cache, according to the algorithm the size of prefetch cache is too
small and it increases it. If the request hits prefetch cache or there is miss
on both of caches then the algorithm leaves the size unchanged. To determine if
the cache size is too large, the eviction cache is observed and if eviction cache
recevies no hits then the size of cache is decremented.
