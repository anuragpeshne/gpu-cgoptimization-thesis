  At the outset, I would like to thank my advisor Dr. Beverly Sanders for providing
  me the opportunity to work on this project and all the guidance throughout the
  course of my thesis work. She provided new ideas whenever I got stuck
  and helped me with finer points. And most importantly she
  introduced me to a whole new area of computation which I wouldn't have known
  to exist if I hadn't got a chance to work on this project.\\

  I would like to thank Dr. Ajith Perera for helping me in the matters of computational
  chemistry. As a domain scientist, he helped me in understanding domain problems
  and benchmarking my experiments on real life jobs.\\

  I would like to thank my committee members Dr. Erik Deumens and Dr. Alin Dobra
  for their advice and feedback on my thesis and research.\\

  I am deeply grateful to my family for the constant support and my brother for
  encouraging me to pursue higher education at a foreign university. And, I would
  like to thank my friend, Snehal, for keeping me motivated and helping me in
  writing my thesis.\\
