\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}\label{conclusion}

This thesis present few of the possible performance optimizations on looping
constructs for SIA.

To exploit GPU in an efficient way several techniques, including GPU streams,
memory pinning, were used.

Exploit CUDA streams to execute non dependent line of execution concurrently.
